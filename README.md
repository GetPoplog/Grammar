# Pop-11 Grammar
This is a work-in-progress. The aim is to provide a couple of formal grammars for the current version of Pop-11. 
The current state of the repo is that the grammars are a hybrid between current Pop-11 and the version of 
Pop-11 described in Sloman and Barrett "Pop-11: A Practical Language for Artificial Intelligence". 

N.B. Work has been suspended for a while, as the contributors had other issues to attend to. We plan to resume this
side of Xmas 2022.
